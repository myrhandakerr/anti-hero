# RE: Tech Fellow application status

Hi Dennis!

This is regarding the status of your application for Tech Fellow. We have received your application and completed all your requirements last *three (3) weeks* ago. We understand that you may have worries about your status and if there might have been something wrong with your application. 

Before we can admit tech fellows into the tech fellow training, there has to be *at least one more eligible Tech Fellow from the same school* who completed their requirements as well. This means that **until there are at least two of you who completed the admissions requirements, we wonâ€™t be able to admit them and they stay in the pipeline**. This waiting process sometimes takes close to a month. 

If there are any interested applicants whom you may know at San Jose State University, you may encourage them to apply and submit all completed and required documents too! We thank you for your patience and understanding regarding this matter.
