#  RE: Request to bump up to Advanced Track

Good day, **John**!

This is with regards to your application for the *Interview Prep* program and request to bump up to the advanced track. Although we are greatly impressed with your background and credentials, unfortunately, upon assessment we can only admit you to the **Beginner Track**.

The following are the prerequisites you need to meet to be able to qualify for the Advanced Track:

- Must have taken at least one basic programming course and an algorithms and data structures course.
- Mandatory attendance for the weekly virtual sessions with 3 excused absences.
- Can dedicate 10+ hours a week to the course and assignment work for 12 weeks

If you want to read more about our tracks, you can click the link below. The first few topics are similar, but the pace of the track depends greatly on the level of the course.

2. [Intermediate Track](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/intermediate_software_eng/overview)
3. [Advanced track](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/advanced_software_eng/overview)


In this case, for now, you only qualify for the **Beginner Track**. As you continue our program in the long run, we are looking forward to admitting you to the Advanced Track. Thank you and best wishes!Â
