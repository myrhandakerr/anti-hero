# RE: Applicant outside US

Hi Jane!

CodePath currently runs classes in Haiti. We also used to run classes in Taiwan. We might be expanding to other countries in the future but not as of yet. Based on the current sponsorships we receive as a non-profit organization, **our courses are restricted to students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States**. 

On the other hand, we also know that completing the application process is very tedious and deeply appreciate you going through it.

As for now, you may be deemed *ineligible* for taking up our programs, since you are living in the beautiful country of Thailand, but we'll make sure that you'll be the first ones to know if we have expanded to your country. We look forward to having you soon.

Thank you and best regards!
